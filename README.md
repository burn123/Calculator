# Calculator
This is a calculator that I designed in my free time during a class in high school. It was when I was first learning about Java and how you should properly structure documents and code logic, so a lot of it is redundant. But it still works for the most part. ;)

If you want to see the calculator in action, go to the `dist` folder and download the .jar file

Feel free to edit it and send me a pull request.
